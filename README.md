BMI CALCULATOR
Objective: Create a BMI Calculator application using Java and JavaFX that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides information on their BMI status according to the Department of Health and Human Services/National Institutes of Health guidelines.

Instructions:

Project Setup:
Create a new Java project in IntellijIDEA. Configure the project to use JavaFX. Initialize a new GitHub repository for this project. 2. User Interface:

Design a JavaFX user interface for the BMI calculator. The user interface should include the following components: Labels and TextFields for weight and height input. A "Calculate BMI" button. A Label to display the BMI result. Display BMI status (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) based on the calculated BMI. 3. BMI Calculation:

Implement the BMI calculation based on user input. Display the calculated BMI in the designated area in the user interface. The formula for BMI is different for English and metric units, so make sure to handle both cases. (Body Mass Index Calculator App) The formulas for calculating the BMI are BMI Formula

Create a BMI calculator app that allows users to enter their weight and height and whether they are entering these values in English or metric units, then calculates and displays the userâ€™s body mass index.

BMI Status:
Determine the user's BMI status based on the calculated BMI using the provided Department of Health and Human Services/National Institutes of Health guidelines.

BMI VALUES Underweight: less than 18.5 Normal: between 18.5 and 24.9 Overweight: between 25 and 29.9 Obese: 30 or greater 5. Menu:

How to create a menu: JavaFX MenuBar Implement a menu bar at the top of your application. The menu should include at least two options: "File" with options for "Exit" and "Clear," where "Exit" closes the application (javafx.application.Platform.exit();) "Clear" clears the input fields. "Help" with an option to display information about how to use the BMI calculator. 9. Documentation:

Provide clear and concise comments in your code to explain the logic and purpose of each class and method. Write a README.md file in your GitHub repository that includes a project description, usage instructions, and a screenshot of the application. 10. Submission:

Commit your code to your GitHub repository. Include interface screenshots in the README file, showing examples with various user inputs. Submit the GitHub repository link for evaluation. Evaluation Criteria:

Proper BMI calculation and BMI status display. User-friendly and intuitive interface. Error handling and data validation. Proper usage of Java OOP principles. Code organization and documentation. Correct implementation of the menu.
